# Build smart contract

This educational process provided a thorough foundation in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. By undertaking practical tasks and publishing progress on GitHub, I gained practical experience and created a portfolio demonstrating my skills. I learned to create ERC20 tokens, manage hashed messages on the blockchain, and automate interactions with smart contracts using ethers.js. Additionally, I explored zkSync and paymasters for handling transaction fees and managing token balances.
